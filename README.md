# MTL-PyTorch

This repository contains PyTorch implementations for CVPR 2019 Paper "Meta-Transfer Learning for Few-Shot Learning" by Qianru Sun*, Yaoyao Liu*, Tat-Seng Chua and Bernt Schiele (*=equal contribution).

The official one is [here](https://github.com/yaoyao-liu/meta-transfer-learning). But right now, the model architecture of its PyTorch implementation is not as same as the paper.
